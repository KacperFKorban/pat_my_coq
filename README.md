# Patat - shorthand matches for Coq proof scripts

> Patat â€“ One of the names for the sweet potato in Polish.

Using Patat, you can pat the hypotheses in your Rocq proofs in a shorter way.

## Example

```coq
From Patat Require Import Patat.

Lemma test : (forall x : nat, True) -> True.
Proof.
  intros.
  pat `forall x, _` (apply pat).
  (* short for:
    match goal with
    | [ H : forall x : nat, True |- _ ] =>
      let pat := H in apply pat
    end
  *)
  exact 0.
Qed.
```
